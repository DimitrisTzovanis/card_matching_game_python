# Matching card game in Python

## Members: Dimitris Tzovanis

### How to Play
- At the beginning of the game, a deck of cards is shuffled and laid out face down.
- Players take turns to flip over two cards at a time with the goal of finding matching pairs.
- Each player, in turn, selects two cards and reveals them. If the cards match (according to a predefined matching criterion),
  the player scores a point, and those cards are removed from play.
- If the cards do not match, they are turned face down again, and the next player takes their turn.
- Players earn points for each matching pair they find.
- The game tracks each player's points throughout the game.
- The game continues until all pairs have been found.
- The player with the most matches at the end of the game wins.
